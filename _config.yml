intro: |
  <p>I am an engineer with 5 years’ experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on the Windows-related web stack, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: Groovy, Linux, Docker and most recently Openshift and Kubernetes; as well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of web-related skills (Graphic design, coding, services, workflows, AWS integrations).</p>

  <p>I enjoy working with interesting products, with understanding of business-related topics, management and emphasis on DevOps culture. Due to my work with consultancy agencies I have a strong understanding of processes, engineering principals and communication with clients and stakeholders.</p>
